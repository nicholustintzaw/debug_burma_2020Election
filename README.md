Quantitative reasoning on SAC's claim Burma 2020 election fraud



This is my initial partial attempt to try the difference-in-transport-cost method [that was part of my ML coruse work and you can some document about that method in reference folder] to investigate two Burma election results distributions (2015 and 2020). met with my ML professor, and he suggested me to do the following

+ try to get the third data point (now I got it from 2010 data) 
+ before application of this approach, check the distribution (of key indicators) across three time-points 
+ investigate the direction (by geographical location or constituency or else) on each indicator (and perform a statistical test to find whether those differences are statistically significant or not) 
+ then, ask me to come back with those results, but I failed to do during my course work

Any other ideas for research or project using these election data?
